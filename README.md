# EPQ-Project on Machine/Deep Learning

This is a Python Image Classifier that I created for my EPQ project. I learned to create the Python Image Classifier from watching "randerson112358"'s tutorials and I had made the user interface using Kivy.

To run the program, you must have the following libraries installed (along with Python):
1) Kivy (Python GUI library)
2) Tkinter (Built-in Python GUI library)
3) Keras (Machine/Deep learning library)
4) Scikit-image (Image processing library)
