# EPQ-Project on Machine/Deep Learning

This is a machine learning image classifier (built using Python) that I created for my EPQ project. I learned to create the Python Image Classifier from watching "randerson112358"'s tutorials and the user interface is created using Kivy.

To run the program, you must have the following libraries installed (along with Python):
1) Kivy (Python GUI library) *some dependencies may need to be installed (check the official Kivy website)
2) Tkinter (Built-in Python GUI library)
3) Keras (Machine/Deep learning library)
4) Scikit-image (Image processing library)
