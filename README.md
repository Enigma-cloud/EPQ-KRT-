# CNN Image Classification (EPQ Project)
A machine learning (CNN image classification) Python application that I built as part of a college project (EPQ).<br/>
 

### Built Using
  - [Kivy](https://kivy.org/#home)
  - [Tkinter](https://docs.python.org/3/library/tkinter.html)
  - [Keras](https://keras.io/)
  - [Scikit-image](https://scikit-image.org/)
  - [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/)
  - [Numpy](https://numpy.org/)

## Usage
This project was developed towards the end of 2019 and therefore it may be broken (due to dependencies) upon installation. 

## Acknowledgements
